    Hello, thank you for visiting my website.
</p>
<p>
    I am Ilham. I have a great interest in the world of videography, where I enjoy operating cameras and capturing precious moments. In every opportunity, I always strive to capture the best angles that can tell a story through the lens of the camera. For me, videography is an art that combines technique and creativity to produce meaningful works.
</p>
<p>
    Besides being skilled in operating cameras, I am also proficient in video editing. I use various editing software to perfect my recordings, from video merging that I do in Adobe Premiere Pro, adding visual effects in Adobe After Effects, coloring in Davinci, and sound enhancement in Adobe Audition. The editing process for me is a very important stage, where a video can become more lively and interesting. I always strive to produce videos that are not only visually beautiful but also have a strong message.

<p>
    Not only involved in the world of videography, I also have basic skills in website coding. I enjoy creating functional and aesthetic websites that can support various digital projects. With this ability, I can integrate my video content into the website, resulting in an attractive and interactive platform. The combination of videography and coding gives me many opportunities to keep creating and innovating in the digital world.
</p>
<p>
    I am confident in always developing all the skills I have.
</p>
<p>
    Every moment I always explore new things that can be used in the working world, I can work in a team or individually, and I have the principle that communication is the main thing in the working world.
</p>
<p>
    I look forward to working with you!
</p>
